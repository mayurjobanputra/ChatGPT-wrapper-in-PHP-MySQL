# ChatGPT PHP & MySQL Wrapper

Welcome to the ChatGPT PHP & MySQL Wrapper, a powerful and flexible ChatGPT integration for WordPress enthusiasts and developers. This project is born out of a passion for WordPress and a desire to integrate ChatGPT in a familiar environment.

## Why This Project?

With 17 years of experience in building on WordPress, the absence of a PHP MySQL installable ChatGPT wrapper that utilizes personal OpenAI API keys was something I was looking for and didn't find. This project aims to fill that gap, providing a comprehensive package easily deployed in a WordPress-like environment (LAMP stack).

## Features I aim to build

- **Wizard Setup**: Easy-to-follow, step-by-step setup wizard, reminiscent of the WordPress manual installation process.
- **Single Zip Package**: Downloadable in a compact zip format for straightforward deployment.
- **Admin Account**: Create an administrator account to manage app settings.
- **User Management**: Offer paid or free access. Add, ban, or manage users with ease.
- **Self Registration & Payment Integration**: Users can self-register and opt for paid access via Stripe integration.
- **API Key Flexibility**: Users can employ their own OpenAI API keys or use a common one provided in the settings.
- **Static Fire Test**: A feature in the admin settings to ensure basic OpenAI functionality is operational.
- **Customizable Settings**: Apply filtering rules, adjust file upload permissions, code reading, and web browsing capabilities.
- **Custom GPT Instructions and Actions**: Add your own instructions and actions to tailor the GPT experience.
- **Ideal for Custom GPT Integration**: Perfect for those who want to create a clone of their custom GPT built using ChatGPT Pro, complete with payment and user management features.

## Current Status

- **Version**: 0.1 Alpha
- **Note**: The application will not be fully ready for use until it reaches Version 1.0.

## Installation and Setup

1. Download the latest release
2. Install in a LAMP compatible web host
